#+title: SmartBus

Using AI tricks to make an intelligent bus schedule site that learns
what buses you want to see and automatically shows you the most

NOTE this project is currently used to pass neural network class at my
university, so that's why 1) it uses neural networks, and 2) looks
like crap.
